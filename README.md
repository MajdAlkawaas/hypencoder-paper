# Hypencoder
Official Repository for "Hypencoder: Hypernetworks for Information Retrieval". Current code includes the Hypencoder model, retrieval code, inference code, and evaluation code. This repo is a work-in-progress; more comprehensive documentation, guides, model checkpoints, etc., will be coming soon. Additionally, code for training and approximate search will be coming soon. This code is a refactor of the original code and hasn't been thoroughly tested at this point, so please be aware there may be bugs or other issues that will be resolved in the next few days.
